# OpenCensus UNIX Domain Sockets receiver

The UNIX Domain Sockets (UDS) receiver allows constrained systems like the
OpenCensus PHP library to export stats and traces over a local unix socket
or Windows named pipe. The receiver will then take care  of transporting
the information to the OpenCensus Agent over gRPC.

By using the UDS receiver in between the OpenCensus PHP library and OpenCensus Agent 
we avoid the need of injecting the gRPC extension into PHP, even making it 
possible to run OpenCensus without the need of installing any extension.

## UDS Protocol

Communication between OpenCensus PHP and OpenCensus UDS receiver is 
handled by using a simple protocol. The protocol is designed to expect partial 
message delivery allowing such a message to be discarded and proceed to ingest 
the next message. This situation can occur when using the PHP user land 
implementation of the Daemon client as it uses non blocking sockets with a 
settable maximum message delivery time to not hold up the PHP request critical 
path.

A protocol message consists of a header and the message payload.

All number representations (UVarint, Float64, padded Float32, Integer) are sent 
in big endian (network) byte order.

### Protocol header

| name           | type    | size  | comment                                                   
|----------------|---------|------:|---------
| SOM            | Bytes   |     4 | Start of message "\x00\x00\x00\x00"
| Message Type   | Byte    |     1 | Message Type
| Sequence Nr.   | UVarInt |  1-10 |
| Process ID     | UVarInt |  1-10 |
| Thread ID      | UVarInt |  1-10 | Will be 0 for non ZTS deployments
| StartTime      | Float*  |     8 | Unix timestamp with fraction: Float64 or padded Float32 (`\x00\x00 + Float32 + \x00\x00`)
| Message Length | UVarInt |  1-10 | **TODO:** identify a maximum allowed message length. This will most likely be dictated by Span exports.

**Note:** PHP can't guarantee the size of a Float when exporting it out. It will 
either be 64 bit or 32 bit depending on the platform. If StartTime is padded 
with `\x00\x00` on both sides we know that all exported floats will be of 32 bit 
length. If StartTime is a 64bit float, all remaining Float values will be 
exported as 64 bit.

By use of UVarInt we have a variable length Header. This allows the header to be 
as small as 17 bytes in the most optimistic circumstances and as large as 53 in 
the most pessimistic ones.

### Data Types

Our messages allow for the following data types and their encoding:

#### Byte
Single unsigned byte holding value between 0 and 255.

#### Float
Depending on the PHP runtime a float value will be either 64 or 32 bit in 
resolution. All floats are big endian (network) byte order encoded. To identify
the size of the float, the Daemon implementation inspects the StartTime field in 
the header. If this field is `\x00\x00` padded on both sides, we're dealing with 
32 bit floats.

#### String
Strings are prefixed by a UVarInt indicating string length immediately followed 
by the unterminated binary string payload. Empty strings are allowed.

#### Array
Arrays are prefixed by a UVarInt indicating the array item count immediately 
followed by the array items. Empty arrays are allowed.

### Protocol message types

The following message types and their contents have been defined.
