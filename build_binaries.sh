# This file is useful to help build binaries or the Docker image
# Usage:
#   It provides a couple of commands like:
# a) Building binaries by passing in the GOOS value e.g.
#    darwin
#    linux
#    windows
#
# b) Build all the binaries by passing in: binaries
#
# c) Building the Docker image:
#    By passing in argument "docker" and optionally the version to be tagged otherwise it'll be "v0.0.1"
