## Introduction

The OpenCensus Service is an component that can collect traces
and metrics from processes instrumented by OpenCensus or other
monitoring/tracing libraries (Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.), do
aggregation and smart sampling, and export traces and metrics
to one or more monitoring/tracing backends.

Some frameworks and ecosystems are now providing out-of-the-box
instrumentation by using OpenCensus, but the user is still expected
to register an exporter in order to export data. This is a problem
during an incident. Even though our users can benefit from having
more diagnostics data coming out of services already instrumented
with OpenCensus, they have to modify their code to register an
exporter and redeploy. Asking our users recompile and redeploy is
not an ideal at an incident time. In addition, currently users need
to decide which service backend they want to export to, before they
distribute their binary instrumented by OpenCensus.

The OpenCensus Service is trying to eliminate these requirements. With the
OpenCensus Service, users do not need to redeploy or restart their applications
as long as it has the OpenCensus exporter. All they need to do is
just configure and deploy the OpenCensus Service separately. The OpenCensus
Service will then automatically collect traces and metrics and export to any
backend of users' choice.

Currently the OpenCensus Service consists of two components,
[OpenCensus Agent](#opencensus-agent) and [OpenCensus Collector](#opencensus-collector). For the detailed design specs,
please see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## <a name="deploy"></a>Deployment

The OpenCensus Service can be deployed in a variety of different ways. The OpenCensus
Agent can be deployed with the application either as a separate process, as a sidecar,
or via a Kubernetes daemonset. Typically, the OpenCensus Collector is deployed
separately as either a Docker container, VM, or Kubernetes pod.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

### <a name="getting-started-demo"></a>Demo

Instructions for setting up an end-to-end demo environment can be found [here](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/tree/master/demos/trace)

### <a name="getting-started-k8s"></a>Kubernetes

Apply the [sample YAML](example/k8s.yaml) file:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f example/k8s.yaml
```

### <a name="getting-started-standalone"></a>Standalone

Create an Agent [configuration](#config) file based on the options described below. Please note the Agent
requires the `opencensus` receiver be enabled. By default, the Agent has no exporters configured.

Build the Agent, see [Usage](##agent-usage),
and start it:

```shell
$ ./bin/ocagent_$(go env GOOS)
$ 2018/10/08 21:38:00 Running OpenCensus receiver as a gRPC service at "127.0.0.1:55678"
```

Create an Collector [configuration](#config) file based on the options described below. By default, the
Collector has the `opencensus` receiver enabled, but no exporters.

Build the Collector and start it:

```shell
$ make collector
$ ./bin/occollector_$($GOOS)
```

Run the demo application:

```shell
$ go run "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/example/main.go"
```

You should be able to see the traces in your exporter(s) of choice.
If you stop the ocagent, the example application will stop exporting.
If you run it again, exporting will resume.

## <a name="config"></a>Configuration

The OpenCensus Service (both the Agent and Collector) is configured via a YAML file. In general, you need to
configure one or more receivers as well as one or more exporters. In addition, diagnostics can also be configured.

### <a name="config-receivers"></a>Receivers

A receiver is how you get data into the OpenCensus Service. One or more receivers can be configured. By default,
the `opencensus` receiver is enabled on the Collector and required as a defined receiver for the Agent.

A basic example of all available receivers is provided below. For detailed receiver configuration,
please see the [receiver README.md](receiver/README.md).
```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
    address: "127.0.0.1:55678"

  zipkin:
    address: "127.0.0.1:9411"

  jaeger:
    jaeger-thrift-tchannel-port: 14267
    jaeger-thrift-http-port: 14268

  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'caching_cluster'
          scrape_interval: 5s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8889']
```

### <a name="config-exporters"></a>Exporters

An exporter is how you send data to one or more backends/destinations. One or more exporters can be configured.
By default, no exporters are configured on the OpenCensus Service (either the Agent or Collector).

A basic example of all available exporters is provided below. For detailed exporter configuration,
please see the [exporter README.md](exporter/README.md).
```yaml
exporters:
  opencensus:
    headers: {"X-test-header": "test-header"}
    compression: "gzip"
    cert-pem-file: "server_ca_public.pem" # optional to enable TLS
    endpoint: "127.0.0.1:55678"
    reconnection-delay: 2s

  jaeger:
    collector_endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:14268/api/traces"

  kafka:
    brokers: ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
    topic: "opencensus-spans"

  stackdriver:
    project: "my-project-id" # optional, defaults to agent project if run on GCP
    enable_tracing: true

  zipkin:
    endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v2/spans"

  aws-xray:
    region: "us-west-2"
    default_service_name: "verifiability_agent"
    version: "latest"
    buffer_size: 200

  honeycomb:
    write_key: "739769d7-e61c-42ec-82b9-3ee88dfeff43"
    dataset_name: "dc8_9"
```

### <a name="config-diagnostics"></a>Diagnostics

zPages is provided for monitoring running by default on port ``55679``.
These routes below contain the various diagnostic resources:

Resource|Route
---|---
RPC stats|/debug/rpcz
Trace information|/debug/tracez

The zPages configuration can be updated in the config.yaml file with fields:
* `disabled`: if set to true, won't run zPages
* `port`: by default is 55679, otherwise should be set to a value between 0 an 65535

For example:
```yaml
zpages:
    port: 8888 # To override the port from 55679 to 8888
```

To disable zPages, you can use `disabled` like this:
```yaml
zpages:
    disabled: true
```

## OpenCensus Agent

### <a name="agent-usage"></a>Usage

> It is recommended that you use the latest [release](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/releases).

The ocagent can be run directly from sources, binary, or a Docker image. If you are planning to run from sources or build
on your machine start by cloning the repo using `go get -d github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service`.

The minimum Go version required for this project is Go 1.12.5. In addition, you must manually install [Bazaar](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#required-tools)

1. Run from sources:

```shell
$ GO111MODULE=on go run github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/cmd/ocagent --help
```

2. Run from binary (from the root of your repo):

```shell
$ make agent
```

3. Build a Docker scratch image and use the appropriate Docker command for your scenario
(note: additional ports may be required depending on your receiver configuration):

A Docker scratch image can be built with make by targeting `docker-agent`.

```shell
$ make docker-agent
$ docker run \
    --rm \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --publish 55678:55678 --publish 55679:55679 \
    --volume $(pwd)/ocagent-config.yaml:/conf/ocagent-config.yaml \
    ocagent \
    --config=/conf/ocagent-config.yaml
```

## OpenCensus Collector

The OpenCensus Collector is a component that runs “nearby” (e.g. in the same
VPC, AZ, etc.) a user’s application components and receives trace spans and
metrics emitted by the OpenCensus Agent or tasks instrumented with OpenCensus
instrumentation (or other supported protocols/libraries). The received spans
and metrics could be emitted directly by clients in instrumented tasks, or
potentially routed via intermediate proxy sidecar/daemon agents (such as the
OpenCensus Agent). The collector provides a central egress point for exporting
traces and metrics to one or more tracing and metrics backends, with buffering
and retries as well as advanced aggregation, filtering and annotation
capabilities.

The collector is extensible enabling it to support a range of out-of-the-box
(and custom) capabilities such as:

* Retroactive (tail-based) sampling of traces
* Cluster-wide z-pages
* Filtering of traces and metrics
* Aggregation of traces and metrics
* Decoration with meta-data from infrastructure provider (e.g. k8s master)
* much more ...

The collector also serves as a control plane for agents/clients by supplying
them updated configuration (e.g. trace sampling policies), and reporting
agent/client health information/inventory metadata to downstream exporters.

### <a name="receivers-configuration"></a> Receivers Configuration

For detailed information about configuring receivers for the collector refer to the [receivers README.md](receiver/README.md).

### <a name="global-attributes"></a> Global Attributes

The collector also takes some global configurations that modify its behavior for all receivers / exporters. 

1. Add Attributes to all spans passing through this collector. These additional attributes can be configured to either overwrite existing keys if they already exist on the span, or respect the original values.
2. The key of each attribute can also be mapped to different strings using the `key-mapping` configuration. The key matching is case sensitive.

An example using these configurations of this is provided below.

```yaml
global:
  attributes:
    overwrite: true
    values:
      # values are key value pairs where the value can be an int, float, bool, or string
      some_string: "hello world"
      some_int: 1234
      some_float: 3.14159
      some_bool: false
    key-mapping:
      # key-mapping is used to replace the attribute key with different keys
      - key: servertracer.http.responsecode
        replacement: http.status_code
      - key:  servertracer.http.responsephrase
        replacement: http.message
        overwrite: true # replace attribute key even if the replacement string is already a key on the span attributes
        keep: true # keep the attribute with the original key
```

### <a name="probabilistic-trace-sampling"></a>Probabilistic Head-based Trace Sampling

In some scenarios it may be desirable to perform probabilistic head-based trace sampling on the collector.
This can be done using by specifying `probabilistic` policy secion under the `sampling` section of the collector configuration file.

```yaml
sampling:
  # mode indicates if the sampling is head or tail based. For probabilistic the mode is head-based.
  mode: head
  policies:
    # section below defines a probabilistic trace sampler based on hashing the trace ID associated to
    # each span and sampling the span according to the given spans.
    probabilistic:
      configuration:
        # sampling-percentage is the percentage of sampling to be applied to all spans, unless their service is specified
        # on sampling-percentage.
        sampling-percentage: 5
        # hash-seed allows choosing the seed for the hash function used in the trace sampling. This is important when
        # multiple layers of collectors are being used with head sampling, in such scenarios make sure to
        # choose different seeds for each layer.
        hash-seed: 1
```

### <a name="tail-sampling"></a>Intelligent Sampling

```yaml
sampling:
  mode: tail
  # amount of time from seeing the first span in a trace until making the sampling decision
  decision-wait: 10s
  # maximum number of traces kept in the memory
  num-traces: 10000
  policies:
    # user-defined policy name
    my-string-attribute-filter:
      # exporters the policy applies to
      exporters:
        - jaeger
      policy: string-attribute-filter
      configuration:
        key: key1
        values:
          - value1
          - value2
    my-numeric-attribute-filter:
      exporters:
        - zipkin
      policy: numeric-attribute-filter
      configuration:
        key: key1
        min-value: 0
        max-value: 100
```

> Note that an exporter can only have a single sampling policy today.

### <a name="collector-usage"></a>Usage

> It is recommended that you use the latest [release](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/releases).

The collector can be run directly from sources, binary, or a Docker image. If you are planning to run from sources or build
on your machine start by cloning the repo using `go get -d github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service`.

2. Run from binary (from the root of your repo):
```shell
$ make collector
$ ./bin/occollector_$($GOOS)
```
3. Build a Docker scratch image and use the appropriate Docker command for your scenario
(note: additional ports may be required depending on your receiver configuration):
